## Action

What's the point of this website? It is to provide a place where the Open Source community can agree with the points raised and put pressure on _Tech Nation_ to accept its fault and apologize to everyone. There are a number of ways to help:

      * Sign the [open letter](letters/openLetter) by Art Deco that summarises the situations by simply signing up with GitHub/LinkedIn, and share it afterwards.
      * Create you own letter, by submitting a [pull request](pr) to this repository.
      * Send [financial aid](https://opencollective.com/nodetools) on Open Collective until the situation has been resolved.
      * Write an email to `info@technation.io` telling them they suck.
      * [Participate in discussion](discussion) and share this webpage using the sharing buttons.
    </ol>

    Thank you all very much. My life and future of an Open Source company in London really is in your hands right now.
