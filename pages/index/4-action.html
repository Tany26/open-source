## Action

What's the point of this website? It is to provide a place where the Open Source community can agree with the points raised and put pressure on _Tech Nation_ to accept its fault and apologize to everyone. There are a number of ways to help:

    <ol>
      * Sign the open letter by Art Deco that summarises the situations by simply signing up with GitHub/LinkedIn.
      * Create you own letter, by submitting a pull request to this repository.
      * Send [financial aid](https://opencollective.com/nodetools) on Open Collective until the situation has been resolved.
    </ol>

    Thank you all very much. My life and future of an Open Source company in London really is in your hands right now.
