## WTFPL

Tech Nation think they have the `WTFPL` license when processing applications, since they are not held accountable to anyone because of the number of people applying to work in technology. The [blog post](medium) (see top) describes how their Senior Program Manager hijacked my application, and made a decision herself, without any knowledge in the field, because she knew nobody would want to investigate a case of a single developer against the whole of Tech Nation. She's crazy. [The review](review) she produced is full of [cognitive biases](biases):

### I. Bandwagon Effect

<block-quote>Believing or doing something because people around you believe or do it.</block-quote>

She demands of me that my tools must be popular, however the point of showing them to Tech Nation, was to demonstrate that I prepared infrastructure for my company, that will help me deliver new quality software quickly. Popularity is not a measure of skill. If a million people download certain software, it doesn't mean that it's made up to the highest standard. An endorsing body MUST not be jumping on the usage count bandwagon, while completely skipping the evaluation of the skill required to make those packages.

###Â II. Dunning-Kruger Effect

<block-quote>Unskilled individuals overestimating their abilities and experts underestimating theirs.</block-quote>

The manager is not an expert in Computer Science and doesn't know anything about software development. Yet, because she think she's seen some number of applications, she can make the decision herself. It is clear from the wording "used a number of frameworks" that she doesn't know what she's talking about, overestimating her ability in processing of the application. Moreover, she says there's no link to the GitHub profile, or that 62 NPM packages is not a track records, which clearly shows that she's not an expert.

### III. Confirmation Bias

<block-quote>Seeking and prioritising information that confirms your existing beliefs.</block-quote>

The review was written in response to a request for a review which was sent after the accuracy of the initial decision was questioned. During a meeting with the manager, she verbally expressed a bias, by saying that "thousands of people have done amazing things by younger age", and that Tech Nation will "review the decision but cannot guarantee an endorsement". Language like that clearly demonstrate a prejudice as it is negative: for example, she could've just said, "sir, sorry for such negligent errors, we'll do a review and I hope it'll fix the situation for you".
