## Criteria

There's the [guidance document](ho_2018) that outlines the criteria (pp 38-40). It asked me to choose 1 key, and 2 mandatory criteria. These are the ones that I picked, with the example of how to achieve them. The Key 2 is given so that you can understand that the guidance clearly distinguished between somebody with a profile, and somebody who's concerned with innovation.

  .Criterion {

  .Criterion:hover {

</style>

<div class="Criterion">
  <h3><img src="./img/idea.svg" alt="idea icon" style="height:2rem" /> Key 1</h3>

  Provide two or more examples of innovation in the digital technology sector as a founder of a digital technology sector company or an employee working in a new digital field or concept that must be clearly evidenced (e.g. patent application).

  <ul>
    * If you are an employee working in a new digital field or concept, this must be clearly demonstrated (for example by providing a patent application).
  </ul>
</div>

OR (not chosen)

<div class="Criterion" style="opacity:0.65">
  <h3><img src="./img/collaboration.svg" alt="collaboration icon" style="height:2rem" /> Key 2</h3>

  Proof of recognition for work outside your immediate occupation that has contributed to the advancement of the sector (e.g. evidence that you have gone beyond your day to day profession to engage in an activity that contributes to the advancement of the sector).

  <ul>
    * Your StackOverflow profile showing significant contribution to discussions around code;
    * Evidence of contributions to an Open Source project;
    * Your GitHub profile demonstrating active participation in a collaborative project;
    * A link to one or more videos of talks or conferences that have had a significant viewership;
    * An op-ed or news article that exemplifies thought leadership, evidence of mentorship.
    * Evidence of sharing or teaching skills, such as mentoring if at a workplace.
  </ul>
</div>

<hr />

<div class="Criterion">
  <h3><img src="./img/positive_dynamic.svg" alt="positive dynamic icon" style="height:2rem" /> Qualifying 2</h3>

  Have been recognised as having the potential to be a world leading talent in the digital technology sector.

  <ul>
    * You led the growth of a company or product, as evidenced by a letter from a co-founder, supervisor or eminent colleague describing your work, or as evidenced by news clippings, lines of code or similar evidence of your choice.
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="Criterion">
  <h3><img src="./img/reading.svg" alt="reading icon" style="height:2rem" /> Qualifying 3</h3>

  Have undergone continuous learning / mastery of new digital skills (commercial or technical) throughout your career.

  <ul>
    * Evidence of having continuously updated technical or commercial skills showing clear progression and achievement. This can be in the form of various projects or courses completed (whether at university or independently), which demonstrate a clear progression either in depth or breadth;
  </ul>
</div>

As you can see, nowhere the guidance explicitly mentions, that I must have had a profile or been known to the community. As I already said above, if I wanted to work on software by implementing and documenting it, and releasing to Open Source, while providing evidence for that in my application, it should had been perfectly acceptable for the application because it's discriminatory otherwise: you cannot ask people for one thing, and then judge them for another. The simple definition of "talent" is as follows: `natural aptitude or skill`, which is logical for the Tier 1 Exceptional *Talent* visa. Moreover, the guidance says:

<block-quote>Applicants who choose to apply under the Exceptional Promise criteria are likely to be earlier in their career, and therefore have yet to establish a track record in innovation. This means that they might not have the same levels of experience as those that would be endorsed via the Exceptional Talent criteria, however they will need to be able to demonstrate the potential to be a world leader in digital technology through their *skills* and *achievements* thus far.</block-quote>

There's a huge role that an endorsing body should play for young independent developers. After graduating from university, or exiting a career path of working in industry, one will find herself totally alone. The Open Source "community" is imaginary as it's not an official social institute. There are corporations like GitHub, or NPM that supposedly represent Open Source, but these are private companies, in the same way that all conferences are organised for profit by also private companies that dictate their own rules. Interestingly, when you go to `npm.community`, you will find the following notice: _The npm.community forum is now moving into archived mode._ The only place anyone can go to is like Reddit. Therefore, if a government is setting up endorsing bodies like Tech Nation, it is their job to provide OFFICIAL public channels that would allow for recognition of work and skill of Open Source developers. There's a huge gap between unorganized internet forums, and an official Open Source program. Yet, Tech Nation is a negligent and hostile organisation that only abuses developers instead by picking on the lack of their "community profile", without appreciating any of this.
