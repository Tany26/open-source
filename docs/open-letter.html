            <p>This letter is in defence of Mr Anton Dmukhovskiy, an Open Source developer who was subject to abusive treatment from Tech Nation when applying for the Tier 1 Exceptional Talent visa in technology. First and foremost, the <a
              href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20180512233606/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/673759/T1__ET__Guidance_01_2018__12.01_.pdf">
              guidance</a> (p.35) published by the Home Office, identifies Promise as somebody who is earlier in their career and is yet to establish a track record in innovation, but can demonstrate the potential to become a world leader via skills and achievements so far. It is crucial that the visa was designed specifically as a recognition channel for young people: at school and University, one is able to receive positive feedback for his/her attempt at studying hard by receiving good grades and merits; after that at work, one can expect salary increases and promotions as acknowledgement of the effort put into making a company a success. However, if a person chooses then to become an independent <em>Open Source</em> developer, there is no official channel through which the importance of his work can be acknowledged. This is why the society invented institutes like Endorsing Bodies that aim to provide approval of innovative contributions to the sector, and establish a reward mechanism to assure young people that hard work pays off.</p>
            
            <p>One of the rejection factors in the review conducted by Tech Nation, was that Anton had to have a community profile by attending conferences. Although there is a number of technology conferences, the bar to be signed up as speaker at one is pretty high, and may be required for the talent route, but not the promise one. The guidance gives a choice of key criteria: one can pick between providing evidence of innovation, or having recognition of work outside of immediate occupation, examples of which include conferences attendance, and the latter was not picked. His additional qualifying criteria included the recognition of potential to become a world leader, and undergoing continuous learning. An example of recognition of the potential was described as leading the growth of a company or product. It was presented as a letter from a colleague who said that his tools for the company are used by staff on daily basis, as well as diagrams of the infrastructure for the company built by him. Continuous learning never required having any profile either. It is therefore conclusive, that the guidance never identifies having a community profile as a mandatory attribute of being a Promise, and if such requirement was set, it must had been articulated very clearly, in the same sentence, e.g.,</p>
            
            <blockquote class="b-r">
              Applicants who choose to apply under the Exceptional Promise criteria need to be able to demonstrate the potential through their skills and achievements thus far, <strong>and they must be known by their peers</strong>.
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>It is unjust to not specify explicitly that one has to have a community profile, and then use it against applicants. People are different, some are extroverted and some are introverted, and a lot of computer programmers will channel their energy into writing a lot of code and building software products and infrastructure, instead of wanting to go out to conferences which bear little significance to their immediate line of work. This is why there are 2 key criteria, and the guidance asks to pick one. Moreover, the Home Office guidance never gives explicit examples for the Promise route, it only says that those applying will have to show skills and achievements and that they are yet to establish track record. If this is the case then why does the review say "we cannot see track record"?</p>
            
            <p>Additionally, Anton submitted evidence of 62 NPM packages made from scratch and required for functioning of a software development company: a testing framework, a documentation tool and a package to bootstrap other packages quickly to improve productivity, and others. To publish packages on NPM already means to have a community profile. Regardless of whether the tools are used or not, they demonstrate the ability to use the infrastructure that is essential as used by all Fortune 500 companies. JavaScript is the most popular programming language on the planet, and receives massive growth year by year. Setting up a process for creating, testing, documenting and publishing packages efficiently and confirming it by uploading 62 packages on NPM, IS a definite track record, regardless of whether such tools are used or not: NPM search is not perfect, and takes popularity as a ranking factor which means that popular tools will be more popular, whereas sophisticated software that is only just published, will not receive any exposure.</p>
            
            <p>Due to the lack of official means of submitting her work, the developer has to go out online and advertise it on specialised forums, but there is no way like in academia to submit her research for a high-quality peer review. Presenting work to random people who have their own values (and who might not even possess any qualification) might not be suitable or desirable for everyone. Whatever rules are established by communities online, will never be of the same standard as at professional science research institutes, and are dictated by members of such communities themselves, therefore it's everyone's choice not to participate in online gathering of people without having any contractual rights there. The form of work that Anton has been doing is very similar in its nature to academic research in the field of Web Computing, according to his specialisation as trained Computer Scientist. The difference between academic, and Open Source research is exactly in the fact, that the latter can be conducted freely by anyone without being a research fellow, yet producing results of equally great significance which are then used to grow a startup. This is how all great Open Source companies started that are now worth millions and billions of dollars. Such work thus deserves an opportunity to be appreciated by proper experts, in this case Tech Nation's, and not the community.</p>
            
            <p>Tech Nation is known to provide ET visas to Entrepreneur First accelerator, which invests in startups that build defensive technology. Any startup goes through 3 initial stages: formation, validation and growth. Tech Nation wants Open Source developers to be in a condition similar to unpaid internship: you exhaust yourself by working on products and putting them online for free, so that Tech Nation can make a decision on your application based on how many stars you gathered, however it's not fair either: if EF startups are allowed to create an MVP first, then validate it through marketing and finally grow, why should an independent Open Source developer not be able to do the same? Everyone has the right to decide how and when to take their product to market, and Tech Nation has no right to tell people how to conduct their business.</p>
            
            <p>If Tech Nation was presented with evidence that the development of company's products is going full-steam ahead with a concrete and viable plan, they had to use that information to make judgement as to the potential of such company. In age of innovation and wealth-unlocking in technology, each simplest innovation should be the reason for celebration of potential to become something big, but instead Tech Nation is intentionally stiffening innovation and prevents growth of a local UK business that could benefit the sector massively. If the visa is given for 5 years, the first two can be used to create the product, next one to gain a profile, and then finally to become the world leader which makes perfect sense. The preparation of work done for this process, ie, 62 packages, education, work experience and skill, is what constitutes a promise, and not a community profile.</p>
            
            <p>The job of Tech Nation, as an endorsing body, is then to assess the skill level. Starting a company by coming up with a name, establishing the development methodology and setting the direction ("all packages will be committed to Open Source"), is a massive step forward and an achievement already, yet it was never recognised by Tech Nation. Neither is academic record (distinction in Master's from the King's College London) and the senior role. Instead, it stresses the fact that that community profile (which was never explicitly required) is feasible "even with limited experience" but the aforementioned factors must had been a much stronger and genuine signal. There are people who received visa who have 4 GitHub commits over the last year, but if Tech Nation checked Anton's GitHub, the link to which was made available via the application form, they would've been able to see 6000 commits. It is plain negligence and falsehood to say that one "cannot see GitHub profile" when it was presented in the application.</p>
            
            <p>Besides, the evaluation of the skill level is clearly done by somebody without professional qualification to do that, as it says that Anton's 62 packages are "a number of tools using a number of frameworks". This is completely inaccurate statement and is actually offensive, as he himself created a testing framework which is the opposite of the stated. It is not possible to make software tools using a framework. Tools could use 3rd party packages, however if the expert was to check dependencies of core packages such as Zoroaster, Documentary and MNP, they would find that they all depend on bespoke packages made by Anton himself. Moreover, the "expert" makes a claim that they cannot see the link to the <em>GitHub</em> profile which is unreasonable since such link was a) in the application and b) is accessible via any of packages in 1 click. On top of that, the claim that "tools are not used by anyone" is also false, as a software tool called <span class="tm">node-exiftool</span> that was mentioned in the application 3 times (in the CV, in the personal statement and in the package release log at position 5) had 1500 downloads per week. Although there was no separate evidence of this download count on an A4 paper, if an endorsing company is paid £456 which is equivalent to 4 hours of work at the rate of £100/hour, they can at least do a little bit of fact checking. It is not unreasonable for an applicant to expect that an expert would open packages' pages to see their documentation and source code.</p>
            
            <p>The Home Office guidelines set out the requirement to be able to create and exploit technical infrastructure which was proven in the application, yet it was never acknowledged in the review. In one year after receiving rejection from Tech Nation, Anton has created a fully new development stack that incorporates all aspects of professional software development process, based on the tools that he started earlier and about which he talked in answering why he was a promise. Furthermore, he came up with an innovative way to compile Node.JS packages which is perhaps in top 5 contributions to the JavaScript community in the last 10 years, as only dynamic linking was possible before. He achieved that in a short period of time exactly because of the availability of his tools that made the work process productive and efficient. His context-testing framework indeed stands out from other frameworks as it allows to publish reusable test contexts, which was confirmed by his referee &mdash; an expert in Quality Assurance, and an expert would not use language constructs like "needs to prove that what he is doing is <strong>truly</strong> innovative", whereas the first expert already said "clearly skilled and talented" in the decision in which Anton also passed his chosen innovation criterion, and there were no analogues to developer-friendly context-testing.</p>
            
            <p>These factors point to the fact that the review was not conducted by an expert in software development but by somebody who supplied the Home Office with inaccurate, incomplete and simply false information. The review process allows to ask for an additional review of new rejection reasons, however when a complaint was made to Tech Nation, their response was that the candidate had run out of options and had to find "alternative visa routes". If Tech Nation was doing their job properly and following the process outlined by the Home Office, they had said the truth, that there was an opportunity to review new reasons, but it is clear that they just wanted to get rid of candidate after having attacked him and his work verbally, knowing that there would be no consequences to them as proved to be true so far.</p>
            
            <p>There were crude errors in the initial decision about letters of recommendation which had to be caught by Tech Nation in the first place, but they weren't which means that <em>Tech Nation</em> are not doing their job at all. Then instead of treating the person with due respect as their client, Tech Nation comes up with insulting lying review that is completely incompatible with actual criteria requirements from the Guidance and truths from package development domain. Finally, the review process was exploited itself as according to paragraph C12, the applicant had the right to object to new reasons, but was not given it which is a form of deliberate psychological abuse that must be investigated and punished proportionally.</p>
