There's no stable (or any) income, trade unions or an independent \"Open Source\" organisation that could provide assistance. We are left to our own devices, yet the whole world capitalizes on our good intentions and inventions. One of companies that thought that it could have its cake and eat it too, is Tech Nation from the UK. They are 80% publicly funded company (£5m annual income from the ministry of culture) with the aim of encouraging the growth of the tech sector, yet they have not spent a penny to help Open Source developers.</p>\n\n<p>All their programs are directed towards companies that receive vendor capital, and no effort on their part is made to back Open Source, either through education, networking or at least tutor channels. At the same time, they claim to be an \"endorsing body\" for a prestigious Tier 1 visa &mdash; where they basically require people to work on their \"community profile\" for free because Tech Nation is not able to understand any technical details and wants the community to do this job for them. <em>Tech Nation</em> has no idea about challenges independent developers face, but at the same time they feel entitled to come up with any random bullshit during the decision process hiding behind the name of the community.</p>\n\n<!-- Open Source Support For Art Deco™. -->\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n  <div class=\"col-sm-6 col-md-4\">\n    <img class=\"ImageHolder img-fluid\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 767.8px) 240px,(max-width: 991.8px) 149px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 208px,253px\" alt=\"back of the head\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='3264' height='2448'/%3E\">\n    <noscript>\n      <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/pages/index/IMG_4788-1140.webp 1140w,/pages/index/IMG_4788-768.webp 768w,/pages/index/IMG_4788-576.webp 576w,/pages/index/IMG_4788-319.webp 319w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 767.8px) 240px,(max-width: 991.8px) 149px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 208px,253px\" type=\"image/webp\">\n        <img class=\"img-fluid\" onLoad=\"webploaded(this)\" alt=\"back of the head\" src=\"/pages/index/IMG_4788-1140.jpg\" srcset=\"/pages/index/IMG_4788-1140.jpg 1140w,/pages/index/IMG_4788-768.jpg 768w,/pages/index/IMG_4788-576.jpg 576w,/pages/index/IMG_4788-319.jpg 319w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 767.8px) 240px,(max-width: 991.8px) 149px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 208px,253px\">\n      </picture>\n    </noscript>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"col\">\n    <h2 id=\"community-profile\">Community Profile</h2>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<span id=\"ceb55\">\n  Please bear one moment while I add the content\n</span>\n\n<p class=\"SectionBreak\">\n  <a title=\"Back To Top\" href=\"#top\">\n    <img alt=\"section break\"\n      src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='40' height='15'/%3E\" data-io>\n    <noscript><img alt=\"section break\" src=\"/open-source/section-breaks/0.svg\"></noscript></a>\n</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>My affection for my guest increases every day.
