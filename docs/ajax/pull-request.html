If you don't agree with any of the points raised there, or want to improve it in any other way, with additional information, you can fork this website, and add your own letter. Here is an instruction how to do that.</p>\n    <h2 id=\"1-fork-and-clone-project\">1. Fork and Clone Project</h2>\n    <p>The project is hosted on <a href=\"https://github.com/art-deco/open-source\">GitHub</a>. You need to fork and clone it.</p>\n    <h2 id=\"2-install\">2. Install</h2>\n    <p>The website is made using the <a href=\"https://github.com/artdecocode/splendid\">Splendid</a> website generator that makes use of Closure Compiler and Closure Stylesheets. After <span class=\"tm\">git clone</span>, <span class=\"tm\">yarn</span> or <span class=\"tm\">npm i</span> commands need to be run. In addition, <span class=\"tm2\">google-closure-compiler-java</span> and <span class=\"tm2\">closure-stylesheets-java</span> packages (10MB and 4MB) need to be added to the project, since it's assumed that they are installed globally in the home directory.</p>\n    <h2 id=\"3-create-a-page\">3. Create a page</h2>\n    <p>The <span class=\"tm\">pages/index.js</span> file contains all pages on the website. Simply create a new directory in <span class=\"tm\">pages</span> dir, and export a new page that points to it. Write your content in the page file using markdown and using other pages for reference. Start the development server with <span class=\"tm\">yarn dev</span> and navigate to <span class=\"tm\">http://localhost:3000/open-source/</span> to preview how the page looks like. It will be automatically added to the menu.</p>\n    <h2 id=\"4-compile\">4. Compile</h2>\n    <p>You'll need <span class=\"tm\">cwebp</span> installed globally and be running on a mac, since <em>Splendid</em> doesn't support Windows yet to create a build, however you can submit a PR without building the website. Run <span class=\"tm\">yarn prod</span> to create a production build.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>",
